Place the provided logo image in this folder with the exact filename `virsa-channel.png`.

- Expected path: `src/images/virsa-channel.png`
- Recommended size: 200x200 or a square image for best results.
- If you're using git, add the file and commit it. Example (PowerShell):

  git add src\images\virsa-channel.png; git commit -m "Add virsa channel logo"; git push

If you need me to embed the image file into the repository, upload the PNG file directly or tell me to add it and I'll provide the exact file creation steps.
